This project models offensive points from FBS college football games this season and predicts the W-L outcomes for the remaining bowl games and potential national championship games. 

The model is simple. It models the (square root of the) points a team scores as a function of the average ranking of the offensive team, the average ranking of the defensive team, and random intercepts for the offensive and defensive team.

The data game outcome data come from [here](https://www.masseyratings.com/scores.php?s=295489&sub=11604&all=1) and the rankings data come from [here](https://www.masseyratings.com/cf/compare.csv).
